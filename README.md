# FYS-STK3155/4155 Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning
## Introduction

Probability theory and statistical methods play a central role in science. Nowadays we are
surrounded by huge amounts of data. For example, there are about one trillion web pages; more than one
hour of video is uploaded to YouTube every second, amounting to years of content every
day; the genomes of 1000s of people, each of which has a length of more than a billion  base pairs, have
been sequenced by various labs and so on. This deluge of data calls for automated methods of data analysis,
which is exactly what machine learning aims at providing. 

## Learning outcomes

This course aims at giving you insights and knowledge about  many of the central algorithms used in Data Analysis and Machine Learning.  The course is project based and through  various numerical projects, normally three, you will be exposed to fundamental research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific results. Both supervised and unsupervised methods will be covered. You will learn to develop and structure large codes for studying different  systems where Machine Learning is applied to, get acquainted with computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course. More specifically, after this course you will

- Learn about basic data analysis, statistical analysis, Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo sampling, data optimization and machine learning;
- Be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases;
- Have an understanding of central algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning;
- Understand linear methods for regression and classification, from ordinary least squares, via Lasso and Ridge to Logistic regression;
- Learn about various neural networks and deep  learning methods for supervised and unsupervised learning;
- Learn about about decision trees and random forests
- Learn about support vector machines and kernel transformations
- Reduction of data sets, from PCA to clustering, supervised and unsupervised methods
- Work on numerical projects to illustrate the theory. The projects play a central role and you are expected to know modern programming languages like Python or C++.
